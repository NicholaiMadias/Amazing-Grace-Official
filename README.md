# Amazing-Grace
Welcome to Amazing Grace Home Living. Providing secure, all-inclusive housing in Tampa and Largo

## Site Sections

### 🏠 Home / Listings (`/`)
The main homepage now serves as the only public listings page for Amazing Grace Home Living.

### 🎮 Arcade (`/arcade/`)
The Nexus Arcade hub — play faith-based games including **Mystery of the Seven Stars** and **Trinity Match**.

- URL: `https://amazinggracehl.org/arcade/`
- Tracks level progress via `progression.js` (localStorage-backed)
- Features a stable, self-contained Trinity Match route under `/arcade/trinity/`
- Certificate viewer: `https://amazinggracehl.org/arcade/certificates/`

### ✝️ Ministry (`/ministry/`)
Faith-based content and ministry resources.

### 🔎 Matrix subdomain comparison workflow (`matrix.amazinggracehl.org`)
Use this **safe comparison flow** when you need to publish a specific historical commit (for example `5a2704c2cc4aaeac9a40ac0d532bbd9bbb5958a4`) without changing production `amazinggracehl.org`:

1. Create a separate GitHub Pages site (recommended: separate repository dedicated to matrix comparisons).
2. Check out the exact comparison commit in that separate deployment workflow.
3. Build and deploy that snapshot to the separate Pages site.
4. Configure the comparison site `CNAME` as `matrix.amazinggracehl.org`.
5. Add DNS `CNAME` record for `matrix` to the Pages target.
6. Keep this repository’s main Pages deployment unchanged for apex production traffic.

## ⚠️ Admin Dashboard (`/admin/`) — Experimental

> **Not linked in primary navigation.** This section is intentionally off-nav and isolated
> so that login prompts, 404s, or experimental features do not affect the main site.

The Sovereign Matrix Admin Dashboard provides browser-based tooling for user management,
audit logging, diagnostics, and admin key generation. It uses a localStorage shim for
demo/dev use and is designed to be upgraded to Firebase Auth in production.

- URL: `https://amazinggracehl.org/admin/`
- Login: `https://amazinggracehl.org/admin/login.html`
- **Demo accounts** (active on `localhost` / `*.github.io` only):
  - `owner@matrix.dev` / any password (4+ chars)
  - `superadmin@matrix.dev` / any password
  - `admin@matrix.dev` / any password

The homepage reads listing photos directly from `assets/images/<slug>/`; the old `galleries/` route tree is no longer part of the site.
